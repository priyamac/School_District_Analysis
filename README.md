# School_District_Analysis
--- 
## Project Overview 

This project analyses data of from a local district, in order to gain insight into performance trends and patterns, to help the school district implement strategic decisions for the schools at a district level. However, after the project was started, it was stated that some files show academic dishonesty in Thomas High School, so the data was reworked to replace those school grades with NaNs, while keeping the rest of the data intact. 

This paper will prepare all standardized tests, looking at reading and writing scores, as well as budget information to help with this analysis. It will then compare the original data with the new data, to see how these changes affected the overall analysis. 

## Aim
-	How is the district summary affected by NaNs
-	 How is the school summary affected by NaNs
-	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
-	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
    -	Math and reading scores by grade
    - Scores by school spending
    - Scores by school size
    - Scores by school type
