# School_District_Analysis
--- 
## Project Overview 

This project analyses data of from a local district, in order to gain insight into performance trends and patterns, to help the school district implement strategic decisions for the schools at a district level. However, after the project was started, it was stated that some files show academic dishonesty in Thomas High School, so the data was reworked to replace those school grades with NaNs, while keeping the rest of the data intact. 

This paper will prepare all standardized tests, looking at reading and writing scores, as well as budget information to help with this analysis. It will then compare the original data with the new data, to see how these changes affected the overall analysis. 

## Aim
-	How is the district summary affected by NaNs
-	 How is the school summary affected by NaNs
-	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
-	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
    -	Math and reading scores by grade
    - Scores by school spending
    - Scores by school size
    - Scores by school type

## Analysis and Results 

### School District Analysis 

PIC OF OLD/NEW Data

When assessing average scores and passing percentages among the 15 high schools in the school district, the average math score dropped 0.05, the average reading score dropped 0.02, the percentage passing math dropped 0.22%, the percentage passing reading dropped 0.12%, and the overall passing percent dropped 0.32%.

### School Summary Analysis 

PIC OF OLD/NEW Data 

Though there's not a significant difference in the overall school district data, Thomas High School can be analysised individually, to see the effects of the grade changes. The average math score dropped 0.07, the average reading score increased 0.05, the percentage passing math dropped 0.09%, the percentage passing reading dropped 0.3%, and the overall passing percent dropped 0.32%.

### Thomas High School Relative Performance 

PIC OF NEW/ OLD TOP

When looking at the top performing schools, even with the dishonest grades taken out, there is no change in Thomas High Schools overall position. 

### Math and Reading Score by Grade

PIC OF NEW MATH/READING SCORES BY GRADE

When looking at math and reading score by grade, it is shown that the 9th grade results for Thomas High School, for both reading and math, have been replaced by 'NaN', while leaving all other scores the same. 

### Scores by School Spending

PIC OF NEW/OLD SCHOOL SPENDING

When reviewing the School Spending summary, this data change did not impact the spending ranges for either the average math scores or average reading scores. However, this data change did impact the spending ranges for passing percentages. According to the summary above, there was a 6% decrease in % passing math, a 7% decrease in % passing reading, and a 6% decrease in % overall passing in the $630-644 spending range.
